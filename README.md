# Maps Resources
This a repository of free resources I have found for working with maps in Latin America and the region.

Along with the data I will leave the credit and the origin of each type of data (please visit the wiki of this repository). 

A small index of the available resources so far:

:globe_with_meridians: **Argentina administrative map**: administrative level 0 (country), 1 (province, national territory, or federal district; provincia, territorio nacional, o distrito federal), and 2 (department or part; departamento o partido) boundaries. _Origin_: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-arg
